# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Sharing or encouraging the use of this tool for malicious purposes or illegal
  activities
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Educational and Ethical Responsibility

As an educational security research tool, whyDPI contributors must:

* Maintain the educational focus of the project
* Provide clear documentation explaining how and why techniques work
* Include appropriate warnings and disclaimers
* Refuse to assist with or encourage malicious use
* Promote responsible disclosure and ethical security research
* Respect the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Code reviews and technical discussions
* Official project communications
* Representing the project in public spaces

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include
using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement via:

* [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/byrdltd/whyDPI/security/advisories/new) (for serious issues)
* Opening a GitHub issue with the label "code-of-conduct" (for general concerns)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Specific Guidelines for Security Tools

Given that whyDPI is a security research tool, we have additional expectations:

### Responsible Use

* Contributors should not use whyDPI or contribute features for illegal purposes
* Discussions should focus on educational value and legitimate security research
* Sharing of techniques should include context about responsible use
* Contributors should respect network policies and local laws

### Knowledge Sharing

* Explain security concepts clearly for educational purposes
* Provide references to academic papers and legitimate security research
* Focus on understanding DPI systems and bypass techniques academically
* Welcome questions from learners at all levels

### Transparency

* Be open about how techniques work (no "security through obscurity")
* Document potential risks and side effects
* Acknowledge limitations and ethical considerations
* Credit original researchers and prior work
